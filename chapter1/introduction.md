## **The purpose of _Technical Communication_**

 **To help you learn the skills you need to communicate more efectively and more efciently in your professional life.**
 
 Communicate technical information for two categories of purposes:
 - To help others learn about a subject, carry out a task, or make a decision. 
 - To reinforce or change attitudes and motivate readers to take action.

## **What Is Technical Communication?**

Technical information is frequently communicated through documents, and encompasses a set of activities that people do to discover, shape, and transmit information. 

It begins with listening, speaking, and reading. when you produce technical communication you use the four basic communication skills—listening, speaking, reading, and writing—to analyze a problem, fnd and evaluate evidence, and draw conclusions.

Unlike academic writing, in technical communication, your audience will likely include peers and supervisors in your company, as well as people outside your company. Your purpose will likely be to reinforce or change their attitudes toward the subject you are writing about, to motivate them to take particular actions, or to help them carry out their own work-related tasks.

## **The Challenges of Producing Technical Communication**

Technical communication is challenging, beacuse:
- There are some  complex devices
- People are complicated, and collaborating with people is at the heart of the process.

When you produce documents, you'd better consider three sets of factors:

1. Audience-related factors: subject, scope, ways, cultural assumptions, writing style, disabilities. 
2. Purpose-related factors: to know or believe or do, to help people perform tasks, to branding. 
3. Document-related factors: budget limits,  schedule limits, particular writing style or level of formality.

**Notice**: In technical communication, you do the best you can with your resources of time, information, and money. The more carefully you think through your options, the better able you will be to use your resources wisely and make a document that will get the job done.
